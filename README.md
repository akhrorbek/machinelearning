# machinelearning
everything I am learning on ML
I started to learn Deep Learning a few weeks ago and I will use this repository to keep my files

I am going to use Github from today so anything I am doing should get updated daily.

I was also previously documenting my journey on Medium blogs (akhrrbk.medium.com)
